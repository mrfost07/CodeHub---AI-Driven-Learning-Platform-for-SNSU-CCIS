# 🎉 CodeHub Platform - Complete Status Report

## ✅ All Issues Resolved!

### Date: October 30, 2025
### Status: **PRODUCTION READY WITH FULL DOCUMENTATION**

---

## 🔧 Issues Fixed in This Session

### 1. Learning Page Runtime Error ✅
**Error:** `careerPaths.map is not a function`

**Root Cause:** Redux state variables were being used directly without checking if they were arrays first.

**Solution Applied:**
- Updated all array operations in `Learning.tsx` to use safe versions
- Changed `careerPaths.map()` → `safeCareerPaths.map()`
- Changed `enrolledPaths.includes()` → `safeEnrolledPaths.includes()`
- All array methods now protected by `Array.isArray()` checks

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/src/pages/Learning.tsx`
